#+title: Todos
* TODO Add a jump-to shortcut for emacs-todos file

* Emacs Server-client work
** NEXT fix issues with emacs client
- e.g. ivy popups disappearing

** TODO find some launcher hotkeys that don't conflict with Apple design guidelines

** make it so the main/server window gets backgrounded + sent to separate desktop by yabai
*** TODO set up special named desktop with a few  "always in the background" things
  - music
  - emacsclient
****  also separate named desktop for "comms"

*** TODO set up a launcher script that will name the main emacs window something unique

*** TODO set up yabai rule to always send that window to its named-desktop (or background it)

*** TODO set up yabai rule to tile emacsclient windows as normal


* Flutter env
** TODO research for a way to fix that weird comment injection behavior on new code blocks (flutter LSP)
** TODO find a way to run flutter in an xwidget window

* TODO Recompile emacs with no titlebar
#+begin_src bash
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-native-comp --with-xwidgets --with-no-title-bars
#+end_src


- this might not work as you hope (hoping that it will "delete" the titlebar entirely, vs remove something else) - in that case just re-compile with the natural titlebar setting

#+begin_src bash
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-native-comp --with-xwidgets --with-natural-title-bar
#+end_src

* Projects
- need to fix treemacs behavior

* switch to Vertico
