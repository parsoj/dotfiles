#+title: Todos

* Emacs Server-client work
** make it so the main/server window gets backgrounded + sent to separate desktop by yabai
*** NEXT set up a launcher script that will name the main emacs window something unique
**** naming the server
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format "Hello world")

#+end_src
**** naming the client
#+begin_src bash
emacsclient -c --frame-parameters='(quote (name . "client-frame"))'
#+end_src

*** TODO set up special named desktop with a few  "always in the background" things
  - music
  - emacsclient
****  also separate named desktop for "comms"

*** TODO set up yabai rule to always send that window to its named-desktop (or background it)

*** TODO set up yabai rule to tile emacsclient windows as normal


** TODO find some launcher hotkeys that don't conflict with Apple design guidelines

* Flutter env
** TODO research for a way to fix that weird comment injection behavior on new code blocks (flutter LSP)
** TODO find a way to run flutter in an xwidget window

* TODO Recompile emacs with no titlebar
#+begin_src bash
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-native-comp --with-xwidgets --with-no-title-bars
#+end_src


- this might not work as you hope (hoping that it will "delete" the titlebar entirely, vs remove something else) - in that case just re-compile with the natural titlebar setting

#+begin_src bash
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac --with-native-comp --with-xwidgets --with-natural-title-bar
#+end_src

* Projects
- need to fix treemacs behavior

* switch to Vertico

* WAIT fix issues with emacs client
- e.g. ivy popups disappearing

- isn't related to yabai (occurs with yabai turned off)

- this issue:  https://github.com/alexmurray/flycheck-posframe/issues/25 suggests it has to do with 'window-configuration-change-hook'

- issue could be related to *vterm* buffer (or at least the first vterm buffer that is opened on startup)
